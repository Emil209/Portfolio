The algorithm:

If you are interested in seeing code I have written, look inside the "LineOfSightAlgorithm" folder. The "Scripts" folder contains C# scripts of the top-down line of sight algorithm I developed for the game. 
There is also a powerpoint presentation inside the "LineOfSightAlgorithm" folder with an explenation on how the algorithm works. A png-file with an UML representation of the scripts and their relations to eachother is also present in the folder.
In the "StaticEdgeScript" file is a description on how you can use the algorithm in your unity project!

The game:

To play the game, extract the "ParanoiaGame.rar" file, then run the "TheGame.exe" file located in the "ParanoiaGame" folder

The green bar in the center-bottom of the screen represent your healthbar. Once it reach 0, you lose. 
You also have an orange "paranoia-bar" next to your healthbar. Your character gets more and more paranoid if he is forced to use abilities, or when enemies are nearby. Once your character's paranoia meter have reached 100, your character can barely focus on reality, preventing him from using anymore abilities, damaging him slightly overtime, and moving 40% slower.
To reduce your paranoia meter, you can press f to "get a grip on reality" by slightly harming yourself. Alternatively, your paranoia meter is reduced when you kill enemies (so killing enemies evens out the cost of using abilities). 

Red orbs are pickups that gives you abilities. Green healthpacks gives you a healthpack when you walk over them. You can use a healthpack by pressing q.

Good luck!

Controls:

W, A, S, and D to move around. 
Mouse to aim.
Left mouse button to shoot.
Right mouse button, 1, 2, 3, and 4 to use picked up abilities.
You can switch keybindings of abilities by left clicking on two abilities.

About the game:

The game is a school project made during my last term at Stockholm University, 2016. We were three programmers and two designers working halv-time on the project for 17 weeks.

We wanted to create a roguelike game that would bring something unique to an already overpopulated genre. What we came up with was what we would call "the paranoia system". The paranoia system adds a strategic element to an otherwise actionpacked game by forcing the player to manage his paranoia levels during and inbetween fights. 

The end result however was more like a demo to a standard "shoot-ém-up" game rather than a roguelike, but we are nonetheless satisfied with the final product. I call it "the final product" because only I was interested in continuing developing the game, despite that me and my team created a very stable foundation to keep working on from, and that the game recieved much positive feedback during playtesting.

The game was made in Unity. All assets (except sound assets) were made from scratch.

My role in the project was to implement the Enemy AI, develop a line of sight algorithm and designing most of the level. I was also considered the unofficial project manager for my acts within the team.
