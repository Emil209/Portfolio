Emil Almkvist's portfolio, last edited 2016-06-19

The "Scripts" folder contains C# scripts of the top-down line of sight algorithm I developed for the game. 
There is also a powerpoint presentation with an explenation on how the algorithm works. A png-file with an UML representation of the scripts and their relations to eachother is also present in the folder.
In the "StaticEdgeScript" file is a description on how you can use the algorithm in your unity project!
